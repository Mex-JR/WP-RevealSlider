# Project Plan: Reveal Slider WordPress Plugin

**Project Goal:**
To develop a robust, user-friendly, and highly customizable WordPress plugin that allows users to easily create and embed "before and after" image comparison sliders on their websites. The plugin should be lightweight, performant, and seamlessly integrate with the WordPress ecosystem.

## Target Audience

- Photographers and Retouchers showcasing their work.
- Interior Designers and Architects displaying room transformations.
- Web Designers and Developers for client projects.
- Contractors and Landscapers highlighting project results.

## Product Features

The plugin will be built with a focus on both powerful functionality and an intuitive user experience.

### Core Functionality

- **Before & After Slider:**
  The primary feature, allowing a user to upload two images (before and after) and display them with a draggable, interactive divider.
- **Draggable Handle:**
  The central element that can be moved horizontally or vertically by the user to reveal the before or after image.
- **Touch & Swipe Support:**
  The slider must be fully responsive and functional on all devices, with support for touch gestures.
- **Flexible Orientation:**
  Allow users to choose between horizontal and vertical slider orientations.
- **Shortcode & Gutenberg Block:**
  The plugin will provide a shortcode `[reveal_slider id="..."]` for classic editor users and a dedicated Gutenberg block for modern block editor users, making it easy to embed sliders anywhere.

### Customization & Styling

- **Handle Styling:**
  - Customize the color, size, and style of the slider handle.
  - Provide options for a simple line, an arrow, or other custom icons.
- **Labels:**
  - Add custom text labels (e.g., "Before" and "After") to the corresponding images.
  - Customize the font, size, color, and position of these labels.
- **Colors:**
  Allow users to change the colors of the handle, labels, and overlay effects.
- **Initial View:**
  Set the starting position of the slider handle (e.g., 50% for a centered view, or a custom percentage).

### Display Options

- **Multiple Sliders:**
  Users should be able to create an unlimited number of sliders, each with its own settings.
- **List and Carousel Layouts:**
  Offer different ways to display sliders:
  - **List:** Display multiple sliders one after another.
  - **Carousel:** Show multiple sliders in a scrollable, responsive carousel, ideal for galleries.
- **Admin UI:**
  A dedicated admin page within the WordPress dashboard to manage and organize all created sliders. This page will include a list of sliders, their shortcodes, and a preview.

## High-Level Development Workflow

This is a suggested path for a development team to follow.

### Phase 1: Planning & Design

- **Define Scope:**
  Finalize the feature list and prioritize which features will be in the initial release (MVP) and which will be saved for future versions (e.g., "Pro" features).
- **Database Schema:**
  Design the database tables required to store slider data (e.g., `wp_reveal_sliders` table with fields for id, name, before_image_url, after_image_url, settings, etc.).
- **UI/UX Design:**
  Create mockups for the admin interface and the front-end slider component to ensure a great user experience.

### Phase 2: Development

- **WordPress Back-End (PHP):**
  - Create the main plugin file and folder structure.
  - Set up the admin menu and pages for managing sliders.
  - Develop the logic for saving, updating, and deleting sliders in the database.
  - Implement the shortcode and Gutenberg block registration.
- **Front-End (JavaScript & CSS):**
  - Develop the core slider component using vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight library. This component should handle the draggable logic and image display.
  - Create the CSS for styling the slider, handle, and labels. Ensure it is fully responsive.
  - Develop the JavaScript for the Gutenberg block to provide a live preview in the editor.
- **Integration:**
  - Connect the back-end PHP with the front-end JS/CSS to dynamically load slider data from the database and render the component on the front end.

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization

- **Unit Testing:**
  Write tests to ensure core functions (saving data, rendering the slider) work as expected.
- **Cross-Browser & Device Testing:**
  Test the slider's functionality and appearance on various browsers and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Performance Optimization:**
  Ensure the code is clean, images are loaded efficiently, and the plugin has a minimal impact on page load times.

### Phase 4: Launch & Marketing

- **Documentation:**
  Create clear and concise documentation for users on how to install, configure, and use the plugin.
- **Plugin Page:**
  Prepare the plugin's page for the WordPress repository, including screenshots, an engaging description, and an icon.
- **Support Plan:**
  Establish a plan for providing user support and bug fixes.
